Here's a refined and separated version of the **Development Story** and **UAT Story** acceptance criteria based on the timeline and feedback you provided:

---

### **Acceptance Criteria for Development Story (ASTM 3.0 and RV-STM v1.0)**

The ASTM 3.0 and RV-STM v1.0 models must be fully developed, integrated, and validated according to the specified timeline. This includes the successful integration of all required data sources, loan-level, and macroeconomic drivers. The model should support parallel execution of runs and validate against current production outputs to ensure scalability, attribution, and performance accuracy. 

- Development must follow the timeline:
  - Requirements completed by **February 29, 2024**.
  - Model development completed by **August 23, 2024**.
  - Testing finalized by **September 20, 2024**.
  - Final documentation completed by **October 11 and October 25, 2024**.

The model should include front book scaling and attribution analysis, ensuring alignment with the latest balance sheet categorization. All discrepancies, including errors in routing or rounding, must be identified and resolved, with results meeting acceptable error thresholds. MRM submission for ASTM v3.0 must be done by **October 30, 2024**, and for RV-STM v1.0 by **November 15, 2024**. 

Upon completion, written sign-off is required from the Model Developers, Forecast Administrators, and GCP Implementation Team to ensure the models meet the specified performance, accuracy, and integration standards.

### **Acceptance Criteria for UAT Story (ASTM 3.0 and RV-STM v1.0)**

The UAT for ASTM 3.0 and RV-STM v1.0 models must ensure that all functionalities, including the handling of new and old portfolio data, meet expected performance standards. The models must undergo thorough testing for scalability, execution, attribution, and front book scaling to validate that the output aligns with production data.

- Functional testing should be completed by **November 30, 2024**, ensuring correct model outputs under various data scenarios.
- The models must support the execution of **3 parallel model runs**, with run times validated (e.g., 30 minutes per run for small datasets) and **18 OMR runs** based on 60-month backtest datasets.
- Walk-forward and walk-across attribution analysis must be validated to ensure they meet the defined performance benchmarks, with run times under **3 hours 37 minutes** for Walkacross. 
- Front book scaling output must be validated against production data, and all rounding errors must be resolved before sign-off.

Final UAT sign-off must be completed by **January 30, 2025**, with written confirmation from the QA team that the models meet all performance metrics and no discrepancies remain.

---

### **Generalized Sign-Off Requirements**

Upon completion of both the **Development** and **UAT** phases, all necessary stakeholders, including Model Developers, Forecast Administrators, GCP Implementation Team, and QA Team, must provide written sign-off. This sign-off ensures the models meet the required performance, accuracy, and integration criteria, with implementation scheduled for **November 2024**.
